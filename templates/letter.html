        <p>
            These past few months have been the happiest of my life. Being around you feels like stepping into a place of endless calm and peace — like everything makes sense when you're near. You're this beautiful, intoxicating presence that fills every part of my being, and I think I've fallen in love with that feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
            All I want is to make you feel as cherished and happy as you've made me. I know I've stumbled along the way, messed up at times, and fallen short. But I'm learning and trying every day to love you the way you deserve — in a way that makes you feel as special as you truly are.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Valentine's Day, let me remind you how much you mean to me. <br>So ummm...
